  <h2>What is Littering?</h2>
  <p>
    Littering is the improper disposal of waste products such as plastics, bottles, papers, and other 
    trash items in public spaces. Instead of being placed in trash bins or recycling containers, 
    these materials end up on streets, sidewalks, parks, and waterways.
  </p>

  <h2>Why is it a Problem?</h2>
  <p>
    Littering causes environmental damage, affects human health, and harms animals. 
    It contributes to pollution, clogs drainage systems, and creates an unpleasant living environment. 
    Beyond its physical impact, littering reflects a lack of discipline and social responsibility.
