  <h2>The Problems with Littering</h2>
  <p>
    Littering does not only harm the environment, it affects people directly. 
    Dirty surroundings decrease quality of life, spread disease, and damage tourism and local pride. 
    It also requires additional government resources for cleanup, which could otherwise 
    be spent on more essential services.
  </p>

  <h2>Examples of Issues</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Clogged drainage systems leading to flash floods.</li>
    <li>Plastic waste killing marine life such as turtles and fish.</li>
    <li>Poor public image of communities filled with waste.</li>
  </ul>
